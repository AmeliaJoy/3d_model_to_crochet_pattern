# crochet_3d_model
 This is a script (in progress) that will eventually convert 3d models into crochet patterns. So far, it finds the geodesic distance from a seed point, allowing it to be split up into rows, and I'm currently adding the capability to find the distance along the isoline from a geodesic from start to finish, which allows me to find the columns.
